# Stranger Graph Thinking Challenge

Welcome to the **Stranger Graphs Booth Demo**.

In this 10–15 minute challenge, you will:
- Create a free Neo4j Aura database (no credit card)
- Load a Stranger Things–inspired graph dataset
- Run real Cypher queries to explore relationships and paths

You’ll leave with a **live graph database you own** and a practical introduction to graph thinking.

## Step 1: Create a Free Neo4j Aura Database

👉 https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/

- Choose **Aura Free**

## Step 2: Load the Stranger Graphs Dataset

👉 [Load the dataset](./load-dataset.md)

- Copy the entire Cypher script
- Paste it into Neo4j Browser
- Run it once

You should immediately see the graph appear.

## Step 3: Explore the Graph

Next, try running some Cypher queries to explore relationships, paths, and patterns in the graph.
